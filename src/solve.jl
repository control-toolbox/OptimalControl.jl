$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

When calling the function `solve`, the user can provide a description of the method to use to solve the optimal control problem.
The description can be a partial description or a full description.
The function `solve` will find the best match from the available methods, thanks to the function `getFullDescription`.
Then, the description is cleaned by the function `clean` to remove the Symbols that are specific to 
[OptimalControl.jl](https://control-toolbox.org/OptimalControl.jl) and so must not be passed to the solver.
For instance, the Symbol `:direct` is specific to [OptimalControl.jl](https://control-toolbox.org/OptimalControl.jl) and must be removed.
It must not be passed to the CTDirect.jl solver.

$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Solve the the optimal control problem `ocp` by the method given by the (optional) description.
The available methods are given by `available_methods()`.
The higher in the list, the higher is the priority.
The keyword arguments are specific to the chosen method and represent the options of the solver.

# Arguments

- `ocp::OptimalControlModel`: the optimal control problem to solve.
- `description::Symbol...`: the description of the method to use to solve the problem.
- `kwargs...`: the options of the solver.

# Examples

The simplest way to solve the optimal control problem is to call the function without any argument.

```julia-repl
julia> sol = solve(ocp)
```

The method can be specified by passing the description as a Symbol. You can provide a partial description, the function will 
find the best match.

```julia-repl
julia> sol = solve(ocp, :direct)
```

The method can be specified by passing the full description as a list of Symbols.
See the [resolution methods](@ref manual-solve-methods) section for more details.

```julia-repl
julia> sol = solve(ocp, :direct, :adnlp, :ipopt)
```

The keyword arguments are specific to the chosen method and represent the options of the solver.
For example, the keyword `display` is used to display information.
The default value is `true`.

```julia-repl
julia> sol = solve(ocp, :direct, :ipopt, display=false)
```

The initial guess can be provided by the keyword `init`.
You can provide the initial guess for the state, control, and variable.
See [how to set an initial guess](@ref tutorial-initial-guess) for more details.

```julia-repl
julia> sol = solve(ocp, init=(state=[-0.5, 0.2], control=0.5))
```
