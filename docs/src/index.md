# OptimalControl.jl

```@meta
CurrentModule =  OptimalControl
```

The OptimalControl.jl package is the root package of the [control-toolbox ecosystem](https://github.com/control-toolbox).
The control-toolbox ecosystem gathers Julia packages for mathematical control and applications. It aims to provide tools to model and solve optimal control problems with ordinary differential equations by direct and indirect methods.

## Installation

To install OptimalControl.jl please 
[open Julia's interactive session (known as REPL)](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started)
and press `]` key in the REPL to use the package mode, then add the package:

```julia
julia> ]
pkg> add OptimalControl
```

## Mathematical problem

A (nonautonomous) optimal control problem with possibly free initial and final times can be described as minimising the cost functional

```math
g(t_0, x(t_0), t_f, x(t_f)) + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} f^{0}(t, x(t), u(t))~\mathrm{d}t
```

where the state $x$ and the control $u$ are functions subject, for $t \in [t_0, t_f]$,
to the differential constraint

```math
   \dot{x}(t) = f(t, x(t), u(t))
```

and other constraints such as

```math
\begin{array}{llcll}
~\xi_l  &\le& \xi(t, u(t))        &\le& \xi_u, \\
\eta_l &\le& \eta(t, x(t))       &\le& \eta_u, \\
\psi_l &\le& \psi(t, x(t), u(t)) &\le& \psi_u, \\
\phi_l &\le& \phi(t_0, x(t_0), t_f, x(t_f)) &\le& \phi_u.
\end{array}
```

## Basic usage

Let us model, solve and plot a simple optimal control problem.

```julia
using OptimalControl
using NLPModelsIpopt
using Plots

ocp = @def begin
    t âˆˆ [0, 1], time
    x âˆˆ RÂ², state
    u âˆˆ R, control
    x(0) == [ -1, 0 ]
    x(1) == [ 0, 0 ]
    xÌ‡(t) == [ xâ‚‚(t), u(t) ]
    âˆ«( 0.5u(t)^2 ) â†’ min
end

sol = solve(ocp)

plot(sol)
```
