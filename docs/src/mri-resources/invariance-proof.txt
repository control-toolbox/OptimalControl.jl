**Definition.** The closed unit ball is called the *Bloch Ball* and is denoted by $\mathcal{B}$.

**Proposition.** The Bloch ball $\mathcal{B}$ is invariant under the Bloch equations if and 
only if $0 \le \gamma \le 2 \Gamma$ and it is the smallest invariant closed ball centered at 
the origin if and only if $0 < \gamma \le 2\, \Gamma$.

Consider the Bloch equations in spherical coordinates. We want to prove first that 
$\dot{\rho} \le 0$ for every point on the sphere, ie. such that $\rho = 1$. On such points 
we have:

```math
    \dot{\rho} = -\delta \cos^2 \phi + \gamma \cos \phi - \Gamma = 
    -\delta X^2 + \gamma X - \Gamma = P(X), \quad X = \cos \phi.
```

This is a degree 2 polynomial vanishing at $X=1$, and its discriminant is
$(2\Gamma - \gamma)^2 \ge 0$,
so $P$ has at most another root $X_2 = {\Gamma}/{\delta}$.
If $\delta < 0$, the polynomial function is negative between its roots, so $P$ is 
non-positive over $[-1, 1]$ if and only if $X_2 \le -1$, that is:
${\Gamma}/{\delta} \le -1 \Leftrightarrow \gamma \ge 0$.
If $\delta > 0$, we need to have $X_2 \ge 1$, that is
${\Gamma}/{\delta} \ge 1 \Leftrightarrow \gamma \le 2\Gamma$.
If $\delta = 0$ then $P$ is non-positive over $[-1, 1]$ if and only if 
$\gamma = \Gamma \ge 0$.

Hence, the Bloch ball is invariant under the Bloch equations if and only if 
$0 \le \gamma \le 2 \Gamma$ but it is the smallest invariant ball if and only if we also 
have $\gamma \ne 0$ since if $\gamma = 0$ then every ball centered at the origin is 
invariant under the Bloch equations and finally if $0 < \gamma \le 2 \Gamma$, then the 
dynamics given by the normalized Bloch equation with a zero control (ie. the free dynamics) 
is linear, its equilibrium point is the North pole $N=(0,0,1)$ and this equilibrium is 
globally asymptotically stable so any trajectory solution of the free dynamics would leave 
any ball centered at the origin strictly smaller than the unit ball. The result is proved.
