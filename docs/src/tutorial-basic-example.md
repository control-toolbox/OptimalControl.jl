# [Basic example](@id basic)

Let us consider a wagon moving along a rail, whom acceleration can be controlled by a force $u$.
We denote by $x = (x_1, x_2)$ the state of the wagon, that is its position $x_1$ and its velocity $x_2$.

We assume that the mass is constant and unitary and that there is no friction. The dynamics we consider is given by

```math
    \dot x_1(t) = x_2(t), \quad \dot x_2(t) = u(t),\quad u(t) \in \R,
```

which is simply the [double integrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Double_integrator&oldid=1071399674) system.
Les us consider a transfer starting at time $t_0 = 0$ and ending at time $t_f = 1$, for which we want to minimise the transfer energy

```math
    \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1} u^2(t) \, \mathrm{d}t
```

starting from the condition $x(0) = (-1, 0)$ and with the goal to reach the target $x(1) = (0, 0)$.

!!! note "Solution and details"

    See the page 
    [Double integrator: energy minimisation](https://control-toolbox.org/docs/ctproblems/stable/problems/double_integrator_energy.html#DIE) 
    for the analytical solution and details about this problem.

First, we need to import the `OptimalControl.jl` package to define and solve the optimal control problem. We also need to import the `Plots.jl` package to plot the solution.

```@example main
using OptimalControl
using Plots
```

Then, we can define the problem

```@example main
@def ocp begin
    t ∈ [ 0, 1 ], time
    x ∈ R², state
    u ∈ R, control
    x(0) == [ -1, 0 ]
    x(1) == [ 0, 0 ]
    ẋ(t) == [ x₂(t), u(t) ]
    ∫( 0.5u(t)^2 ) → min
end
nothing # hide
```

Solve it

```@example main
sol = solve(ocp)
nothing # hide
```

and plot the solution

```@example main
plot(sol)
```
